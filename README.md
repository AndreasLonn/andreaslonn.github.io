This repository contains web pages. Here are links:

## [Quite Secure Notes](https://andreaslonn.se/quitesecurenotes.html)
[Quite Secure Notes](https://andreaslonn.se/quitesecurenotes.html) is another web page that stores the user's notes, but encrypted using AES-256. As I'm not a security expert it shouldn't be trusted as completely secure.

## [Certificate Viewer](https://andreaslonn.se/certviewer.html)
[Certificate Viewer](https://andreaslonn.se/certviewer.html) creates a link to `about:certificate` based on either text or file input
